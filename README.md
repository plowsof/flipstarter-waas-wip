Docker repo/instructions here https://hub.docker.com/r/plowsof/waas4rucknium-testnet   

Currently, this will just create a mirror of the page @ rucknium.me/flask, however, i will eventually be making a generic version, and use the rucknium page as an example of installing a template (just copy and pasting a folder) 

### TODO
- [ ] Fix Negative bitcoin donations :) 
- [ ] non-js version incorrect and donations should trigger an update 
- fix bugs in
    - [x] install wizard
    - [ ] edit wishlist 
- [ ] sanity checks

### Support
The initial funding for this project was obtained through Bitcoin-cash' crowdfunding system - FlipStarter.
I will not be asking for any donations for this particular projects further development until someone using this WaaS receives their first (mainnet) donation / and i have fulfilled my FlipStarter promises. I think thats fair right? :)

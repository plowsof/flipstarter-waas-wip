Docker repo/instructions here https://hub.docker.com/r/plowsof/waas4rucknium-testnet   

Currently, this will just create a mirror of the page @ rucknium.me/flask, however, i will eventually be making a generic version, and use the rucknium page as an example of installing a template (just copy and pasting a folder) 

### TODO
    
Tutorials will come after:    
- [x] the list can be edited while running

- [x] update monero / bch / btc wallet files
- [ ] clean up the prompts / text shown (pretty colours)
- [x] a prompt if user wants to supply their viewkey (else wallets are made for them)
- [x] static version for Non-JS users
- [x] Dockerise:

### Support
The initial funding for this project was obtained through Bitcoin-cash' crowdfunding system - FlipStarter.
I will not be asking for any donations for this particular projects further development until someone using this WaaS receives their first (mainnet) donation / and i have fulfilled my FlipStarter promises. I think thats fair right? :)
